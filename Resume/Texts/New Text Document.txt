high school student, natural sciences and mathematics, 3rd year( I'm still going, until I'm 4 grade, and i planned collage for computer science). I dedicate most of my free time to perfecting my programming skills. I am currently learning HTML, CSS and Java script. I am familiar with IDE such as visual studio code, sublime and notepad ++. As for HTML, I went through JADE and EJS (Embedded javascript), while on the other hand CSS (LESS, SASS). I also know how to work in code-kit. Bootstrap and the 960 grid are no strangers to me. On the other hand, my knowledge of javascript is at a beginner's level, such as JQurey and under score. Later, the direction in which I would go is angular.js and node.js. I have experience in UI design and applications such as adobe xd and figma.
In addition to school and programming, I like to set aside my time for the people I love and care about. Once a week, I attend acting classes in which I have experience for a whole year.I love digital design and I have a little experience in it, I made Cover-arts for friends and their songs. I like listening to music and drawing on canvas, a lot of people say that I have a gift for drawing and that I stay creative for both drawing and problem solving.
